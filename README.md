# Welcome to the [CS2340](https://oscar.gatech.edu/bprod/bwckctlg.p_disp_course_detail?cat_term_in=202302&subj_code_in=CS&crse_numb_in=2340) Team 2 Github!

## Project Outline
The end result of this project is a 2D Dungeon Crawler Game. 

A user will have the ability to control a player and navigate through dungeon rooms with different layouts and enemies. A user will have the ability to attack and destroy enemies, collect powerups, and reach exits that take you to the next room. The enemies will be able to attack the player - making the player lose health. When the player runs out of health, the game is over. To win, the player must reach the exit of every room. 

Compete with other players to obtain the high score - featured at the end of the game.
